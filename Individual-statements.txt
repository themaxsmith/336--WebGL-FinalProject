Maxwell Smith:
Here are the parts I worked on:
1. Setup the project (used webpack cli to generate the project base)
2. Used three.js to create the 3D scene and manage general rendering
3. Learned how to do custom shaders in three.js (via the ShaderMaterial class in three.js docs)
4. Created the shader for the sprite sheet and door classes
5. Implemented the sprite sheet and door classes
6. Completed the Fire uniform update and sprite look at camera functions
7. Implemented the overlay document (using Vue.js) and explanation of the project
8. Found real-world examples of the demos and added them to the overlay document

Sources:
We created this project from scratch, but we used the following resources to help us:
I used webglfundamentals.org for the implmentation ideas related to sprite sheet for the shader
I used the three.js docs for how to implement the custom shader material class.
I knew vue.js + webpack from the previous project, so no resources were used for that.
All parts of Fire.ts, Door.ts, and BlockFromSpriteSheet.ts were written by me or caleb
Index.ts was written by us, but we used the three.js docs for the implementation. There may be some parts of the code that are similar to the three.js docs. These are cited in code
Textures are cited in the overlay or/and in the code. Some were created by us, some were found online.
