Maxwell Smith:
Here are the parts I worked on:
1. Setup the project (used webpack cli to generate the project base)
2. Used three.js to create the 3D scene and manage general rendering
3. Learned how to do custom shaders in three.js (via the ShaderMaterial class in three.js docs)
4. Created the shader for the sprite sheet and door classes
5. Implemented the sprite sheet and door classes
6. Completed the Fire uniform update and sprite look at camera functions
7. Implemented the overlay document (using Vue.js) and explanation of the project
8. Found real-world examples of the demos and added them to the overlay document

Sources: Cited in the code and in the overlay document, but the main one is the three.js docs + course notes
